## Commits

For every code update that you see them important as big changes, you need to commit your updates with clean documentation.

First, fork this repo button on top of your screen.

Then, go to your profile and clone your forked repo.

```bash
  git clone git@github.com:yourname/yasin_tost.git
```
First step is to create a new branch.

```bash
  git checkout -b development
```

So we can merge your features within pull requests. 
After your code changes you need to commit your changes to development branch.
You are still in development branch.

```bash
  git commit
```

It will open a new window for your commit message. (In vscode)

- **fix**: patches a bug in the codebase
- **feat**: introduces a new feature to the codebase
- **refactor**: only used when refactoring code
- **docs**: used when modifying/creating docs

Write your clean commit messages effectively.

**Warning!!** You need to stay in your development branch to push your forked repo.
In this case it is **yourname/yasin_tost** repo.

So with this step, you are ready to push your commits into your repository. 

```bash
  git push --set-upstream origin development
```
This code needs to be executed just one time at first. Then you can use 

```bash
  git push
```
to push your changes to development branch of your repo.




  
## Goals

- You are free to use any front-end service that you like. 

- The website you need to be impressed is : https://www.duzdagtost.com/

- You are free for design. I will provide the images of toast shop and his services. No rush, at first you can use google images as well.

- It should be responsive for mobile devices as well, not necessary for tablets.

- You may **Pull Request** to origin repo (mustfakara/yasin_tost) every once of two weeks but it is not necessary. We can do this at final situation. 

- Estimated deadline is **First week of November 20204**.

- Add demo images into folder and edit readme file, so the other people can see without cloning the project.

**Good Luck**
